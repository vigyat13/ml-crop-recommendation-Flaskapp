🌾 Crop Prediction Web Application
This project is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts the most suitable crop to cultivate based on environmental parameters. Built using Python's Flask framework, it leverages a trained Random Forest model to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts in making informed decisions.

📌 Features
User-Friendly Interface: Input environmental parameters through a simple web form.

Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a trained Random Forest model to predict the optimal crop.

Ordinal Encoding: Handles categorical features like 'season' using OrdinalEncoder.

Error Handling: Provides clear messages for invalid inputs or prediction errors.

Deployment: Hosted on Vercel for seamless accessibility.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x: Core programming language.

Flask: Web framework for building the application.

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical operations.

Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training and encoding.

HTML/CSS: Frontend design for the web interface.

Vercel: Platform for deploying the web application.
